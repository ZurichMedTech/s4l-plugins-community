## üîñ Versioning & Changelog

* Plugin versions are based on **Git tags** in your plugin repository (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.2`).
* The version defined in your `manifest.json` must match the corresponding Git tag.
* The latest Git tag is used to determine the **currently installable version** in the marketplace.
* Tags are also used to **generate changelogs** automatically by comparing releases (e.g., based on release notes or commit diffs).

### Example

```bash
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```

If your changelog is derived from GitHub releases, make sure to **include a release message** when publishing a tag.

## üìÖ Plugin Review Process

Once you submit your merge request:

* We will verify that the repository is accessible and contains a valid `manifest.json`.
* We will validate the presence of a plugin icon and required metadata fields.
* We will confirm that the version in `manifest.json` matches a Git tag.
* If everything looks good, your plugin will be added to the community store!
